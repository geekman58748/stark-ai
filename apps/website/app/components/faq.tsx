  },
  {
    q: "How does it know I’m running low?",
    a: "From your purchase history, and soon from a photo of your meter’s screen. It warns you a few days before you’d run out.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if it mishears me?",
    a: "It repeats the bill and the amount before paying, and anything outside your limits or your saved bills is refused anyway.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will it pay just because someone in the room says something?",
    a: "No. Voice notes only count when they include the word “Stark”, so everyday talk never triggers a payment.",

    q: "Who holds my money?",
    a: "You do. Stark can only pay the bills you added, inside limits only you can change. You can withdraw at any time.",
