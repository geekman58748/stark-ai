"""What Stark notices on its own — every line computed, nothing invented.

This replaces the old hand-written suggestion list: one live line and one
hardcoded lie ("Your AC is 78% of your usage this week") that no data ever
supported. Everything here is derived from what the server actually holds —
the meter, the wallet, delivered receipts, telemetry samples and renewal
dates. A signal with no data behind it is simply not returned: an empty list
is honest, a fabricated line is not.

Pure by design: the caller passes state in, dicts come out, and the only
clock is the one you hand it. `build()` is the server's single entry point.
