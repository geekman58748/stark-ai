"""When a bill is supposed to be paid — and the one line Stark says about it.

A bill that knows its own renewal date is the difference between "Stark, what
do I owe?" and Stark telling you first. `renews_on` is an additive field on a
bill (docs/API.md): a calendar date, YYYY-MM-DD, unset for meters and lines
that do not renew on a schedule.

Everything here is pure: dates in, dicts out, no clock unless you hand it one,
no store, no network — so the rules are testable and the server stays a stub.
The notify log is the one piece of state, and it is deliberately in-memory:
this demo sends at most one reminder per bill per renewal date, and losing
that on a restart costs a repeat message, never a payment.
