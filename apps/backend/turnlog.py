"""One JSON line per conversation turn: what was said, heard, answered, cost.

An observation tool, not a product feature — nothing at runtime reads it back.
It exists so a person can answer, after a real conversation, "what did Stark
actually hear, what did it do with that, and where did the time go" — instead
of guessing from memory.

Opt in with `STARK_TURN_LOG`: a directory to write into, or `1` for
`<backend>/logs/turns`. Off by default, so tests, smoke runs and demos leave
nothing behind.

Three rules:

- **A log never breaks a request.** Every public function swallows its own
  failure: a full disk or an unwritable path must not turn a spoken question
  into a 500.
- **One file for the words.** `turns.jsonl`, one JSON object per line, appended
  under a lock — the HTTP server is threaded. A clip is binary, so it lands in
  `audio/` beside the log and the line describing it carries a relative path.
  No base64 in the log: it would make the file unreadable within a session.
- **Config read at call time**, like `stt` and `tts`, so the flag can be
  flipped without rebuilding the server.
