"""Withdrawing as crypto: the treasury's USDC, swapped by 1Click into what the user wants.

    quote (USDC on NEAR → asset, to the user's address) → hold the naira
    → sign the treasury's transfer and store it → broadcast → `processing`
    → 1Click `SUCCESS` (`paid`) or `REFUNDED`/`FAILED` (the money comes back)

The naira is converted at `STARK_USDC_NGN_RATE`, rounded down, so Stark never sends
more USDC than the naira covers. What arrives is `amountOutFormatted` of the asset,
after 1Click's swap; a refund returns the USDC to the treasury and the naira to the
user.

**Caps.** The treasury key can move real money, so every request is checked against
`STARK_CRYPTO_WITHDRAW_MAX_NGN` (one withdrawal) and `STARK_CRYPTO_WITHDRAW_DAILY_NGN`
(everything not returned in the last 24 hours, across all users) before anything is
quoted or held. The daily check and the hold run under one lock, so two requests
cannot both squeeze under the limit.

**Never twice.** The signed transfer is written to the row before it is broadcast.
A timeout or crash is retried with the same bytes, and a failed broadcast is checked
against the chain before anything is re-signed: a new signature only happens when
the old transaction provably cannot land (expired, or its nonce was spent elsewhere).
