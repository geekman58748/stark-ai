"""Keeps each user's onchain vault in step with their wallet in Postgres.

Postgres is what the app reads; the vault is what the agent's key is bound by.
They agree because every money movement in Postgres has a vault counterpart, and
that counterpart is written to an outbox (`chain_ops`) **before** it is sent:

| Postgres | Vault | When |
|---|---|---|
| deposit credited | `fund(amount, reference)` | Bachs collection, Intents deposit |
| withdrawal debited | `debit(amount, reference)` | bank withdrawal |
| withdrawal reversed | `fund(amount, reference)` | Bachs payout failed |
| payment not delivered | `refund(payment_id)` | VTpass failed after `pay` |

Policy (caps and the meter allowlist) is synced **at payment time**: before `pay`,
the vault's `get_policy` is compared with the account's current limits and
`set_policy` is sent if they differ. Caps only bind at the moment of paying, so
this is exact where it matters, and settings screens need no chain calls.

A broadcast that fails for a network reason stays `pending` and is retried by the
money loop. Every op is safe to resend: `fund`/`debit` carry a reference the
contract applies once, and `refund` applies once per payment. A refusal from the
contract itself (say, a debit over the vault balance) is `failed` and is not
retried; it means the two ledgers disagree, which `drift()` reports.

`pay` is the exception: it is synchronous, because it is the authorisation. A
user's pending ops are flushed first — a deposit must land before it can be
spent — and if any are still stuck, the payment is refused rather than signed
against a vault that is behind.

With no chain configured (`VaultChain` is None) every method is a no-op and
payments book off-chain, as they always have offline.
