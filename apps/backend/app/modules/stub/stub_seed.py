"""The artboard's account: three bills, ₦64,200, ₦23,000 spent and six receipts.

Only `POST /v1/_stub/reset` uses it, so smoke runs and demos start from the same
numbers. Real accounts are never seeded: they open empty.

Meter, phone and smartcard numbers are fake but shaped like the real thing, and
every timestamp moves with the clock, so a demo always has one bill inside the
reminder window.
