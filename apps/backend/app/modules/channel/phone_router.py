"""The gates every phone door shares: dedupe, commands, identity, wake, agent.

WhatsApp and SMS differ only in transport — how a webhook is signed, how media
is fetched, how a reply goes out. What happens to a verified message is the same
for both, and it is the Telegram door's order (`telegram/telegram.py`):

1. **Dedupe.** The message id is claimed in `processed_messages` before any work,
   so a provider's retry cannot double-pay.
2. **Commands.** `link 482913`, `unlink`, `whoami`, `pause`, `resume`, `help` — a
   leading `/` is optional, because a phone keyboard has no command menu. Only a
   message that *is* a command counts: "pause my airtime top-up" is a request.
3. **Identity.** An unknown number gets link instructions and nothing else —
   never state, never the agent, never a payment.
4. **Wake gate, for voice only**, by the same `wake.py` rule `/v1/voice` uses.
5. **The agent**, scoped to the linked account. One brain: nothing here branches
   on channel except the words of a reply.

Logs carry the outcome, the account id and the last four digits of the number —
never a message body, a transcript or a full number.
