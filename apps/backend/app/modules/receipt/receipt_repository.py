"""The receipt store — Postgres over Neon's HTTP endpoint.

Two things live here that matter more than the storage itself:

1. **`request_id` is the idempotency key.** VTpass books a second sale if the same
   purchase is retried with a new id (code `019`). A receipt therefore stores its
   `request_id` from the moment it is created, and a retry of the same intent finds
   that row and reuses the id. `find_pending()` is how the payment path does it.
2. **The wallet is persisted next to the receipts.** Otherwise a restart would keep
   the history but forget the balance, and the two would disagree — which is exactly
   the kind of bug that makes a demo lie.

Everything is scoped to an account (`user_id`), because accounts are real now: two
people can sign up and neither sees the other's balance, history or bills.

**There are no transactions to open here.** Neon's HTTP endpoint runs one statement
per request and refuses multi-statement strings, so the money paths are written as
single statements that do both halves at once — `WITH w AS (UPDATE wallets ...)
INSERT INTO receipts ... SELECT ... FROM w`. If the balance cannot cover a charge the
`UPDATE` matches no row, the `INSERT` has nothing to select from, and nothing is
written. Never split one of those into two queries.

Money is integer naira. Units are a float because the tariff is fractional, and
units are not money.
