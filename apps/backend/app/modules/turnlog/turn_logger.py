"""Writes one conversation turn per exchange — voice and Telegram alike.

Every exit from a voice turn is logged: a turn Stark refused to hear and a turn it
answered are exactly the two a person wants to compare afterwards. `conversation`
is present only when the agent ran, and carries the whole exchange (prompt,
account and all), so "why did it say that" has an answer.
