"""Who is talking to us — channel identity linking and webhook dedupe.

The rules this file exists to enforce (HANDOFF §8A):

- **An unknown sender never creates a wallet and never pays.** A Telegram chat that
  has not been linked gets link instructions and nothing else — the agent is never
  called for it.
- **Linking is the only way a channel can claim an account.** A `user_id` in a
  message or a webhook body is never trusted; the only claim that counts is a
  6-digit code issued by the app and redeemed here.
- **One identity maps to exactly one user**; one user may have many identities.
- **Link attempts are rate-limited** and codes expire, are single-use, and are
  stored hashed.

Phone channels normalise to E.164 before calling into this module; Telegram keys
on the numeric chat/user id. Nothing here keys on a display name.

The tables live in the same database as the receipts, next to `neon_auth.*`. A
`user_id` here is the **app account id** (`accounts.id`), not the auth provider's —
`auth_service.py` maps between them, so unlinking and relinking a channel never touches the
login the person uses.

Unlike the money paths in `receipt_repository.py`, consuming a link code is a handful of
statements rather than one. Neon's HTTP endpoint gives no transaction to open, so the
order is chosen to fail safe: the identity is bound **before** the code is marked
used, and a crash in between leaves a code that can be redeemed once more rather
than a chat bound to the wrong account.
