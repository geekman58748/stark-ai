"""Every `/v1` route is somebody's data, so it needs a live Neon Auth session.

The token comes from `Authorization: Bearer`, or from `?token=` for the one route an
`<audio>` element plays (it cannot set a header); a query string is a last resort
that ends up in access logs. An unauthenticated request never falls through to
anyone's account.
